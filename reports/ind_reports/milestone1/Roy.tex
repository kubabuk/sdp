\maketitle

\section{Your Contribution to the Group}
During the last two weeks, I give a first try to this milestone, from both the robot assembling and code aspects. After that, I helped doing experiments with the robots and fixing problems by changing the code or the robot structure.

\section{High Points of Your Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I wrote basic robot code for the moving and sensors.
  \item I helped building and testing the robot for this milestone.
  \item I did some study about the Lejos API.
  
\end{itemize} 

\section{Areas to Improve}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I would like to focus more on the task I was allocated to do later.
  \item I need to do more study of codes from previous years and learn the best from them.
\end{itemize}
